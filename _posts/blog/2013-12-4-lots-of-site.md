<p class="lead">Holy site updates, Batman!</p> There is a freakin' huge amount of new stuff on the website! I encourage you to check it all out.

## Creative Section
See that little drop-down section up in the navigation, there? Yeah, the one with that cute carat next to it. That there leads to some of the most interesting new content on the website! I'm happy to present the [art page](/creative/art.html) (which currently has no content... haha), the [writing page](/creative/writing.html), and the [music page](/creative/music.html)! The music page is my favorite, but they all have stuff that I've made, and I'll be sure to add to them often!

## About Page & Contact Page
Goodness Vulcan, those look pro-fesh! The [about page](/about.html) finally tells you a little about myself, and thanks to the [contact page](/contact.html), you can finally get a hold of me!

## Portfolio Page
It was at this point and time that I realized that, at the moment, I don't really have a lot of websites that I have made recently and thus am tremendously proud of. But, that didn't stop me from putting [my one pride and joy](http://mcrot.mariahthornquest.com) on the all-new [portfolio page](/portfolio.html)!

## Footer
If you've got an ounce of geek in you, I strongly recommend checking out [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which is what my website here is built on. It's lightning fast, flexible, and a wonderous breeze to make websites with. Jekyll and [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com) both made the footer of my website, because as it so slyly states, I am tremendously proud to be powered by those platforms.

Hope you guys enjoy all of this new content, because I sure loved making it!
