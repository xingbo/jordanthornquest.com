	I tossed and turned in my bed. I wasn't sure how to feel. Did she really, just... bite me?
	I stared out over my room. It was dark. It was really, really late. but unlike any night I could recently remember, I just couldn't fall asleep. My body was always the wakeup at 6, go to bed at 8:30 or MAYBE 9. It was 1:30, now. This was ridiculous. 
	I followed along the cracks at the top of the wall, tracing the path that they made onto the ceiling and across the room. After about 4 and a half paths, I got bored of that. I tried counting sheep, but I got bored of that. I even tried reciting poetry, lines from Pride and Prejudice. Nothing. I never got bored of that, but it was clear that these things were NOT working. I couldn't go to sleep. 
	I rolled out of bed and rubbed my eyes. Should I check Facebook? No, nobody would really be up at this hour to talk to. Should I read my book? No, I might wake up Evangeline. I can't even go downstairs, because Jack's sleeping on the couch. I can't believe his room had to flood. Now I can't even go downstairs and cook something without possibly waking him up. Then again, waking him up wasn't nearly as bad as waking up Evangeline. But if I go down the stairs, I could wake everyone up. 
	I flopped back into bed with a huff. Images of the day flashed in front of my mind. Mom was devastated. After the chickens all got out, plus the fact that she lost her job, the fact we haven't had any money, and that the water and internet's been shut off for 4 days... She finally just passed out in the back yard. Thankfully, dad was man enough to carry her up the stairs to her bed. I couldn't have managed that. But then again, I managed just about everything else in this house. 
	I couldn't believe what had happened today, either. The dogs often got out of the yard, especially recently, sure, but Star had never bitten me before! She seemed like she wasn't just trying to run away, she didn't even want to come back. And of course, Snoopy disappeared as usual. Jack just gave up on finding him again, insisting as usual that Snoopy would come back on his own. I mean, he did, usually... But not this time.
	What changed? Jack had started chaining the beagles to the gate only a week before, letting them off at night and re-hooking them in the morning. Star knocked her water bucket over yesterday. Did they finally think that we just didn't care about them anymore? That we were content with just letting them starve?
	Maybe it's for the better that they ran away. 
	We can't take care of them. We don't have any money to take care of ourselves anymore. Dad's insisted on getting rid of them several times, and Evangeline has always been behind him on that. Mom's been fairly indifferent both ways, but then there was Jack.
	Jack insisted that there was still good in them. He was sure that they just needed attention, that we just needed to walk them and take better care of them. "They were bored," he said. "If we walk them, they won't want to get out of the yard." The problem that he himself was probably one of the busiest people in our family, balancing his work, his NaNoWriMo project, a guitar gig in December, and his high school work on top of several other projects he mentioned he was busy doing. He was the least likely person to even begin to be able to put aside time for the dogs.
	Maybe it was better this way, with Star leaving. Maybe she's happier this way. Maybe it was God's plan all along. I don't think Jack could have let them go by himself.
	And even then, I'm worried about her. 
	I crawl back under my covers and look around my room at my shelves, with all of my books and my small trinkets Evangeline gave to me. I look at the paintings I've made on our walls, our posters and pictures that we've hung up there of horses, cool blue dandelions, ballet shoes, and dancers. Our floor is covered with Evangeline's things, and all of our clothes from the last few days. It's a bit of a mess, even in the dark. You'd think the dark would cover these things up, like stuffing them under your bed, but instead it's just a bunch of obvious dark lumps of random stuff instead than one you can see clearly. 
	I heard a dog howl in the neighborhood somewhere, and my mind went back to Star. That big, scary german shepherd chasing her, that truck almost hitting her... Was she still alive?
	I shut my eyes as best as I could and tried to go to sleep.
	I hoped she was doing okay.
