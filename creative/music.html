<h3>Jentry Hagan <small>2013</small></h3>
<p>This set was done with Miss Jentry Hagan, a local Idahoan vocalist with a beautiful voice. I played guitar, and she did the hard stuff. I expect to record more of her soon.</p>

<h3>Live at the Moxie <small>2012</small></h3>
<p>This set was one of my first live gigs. You can hear the nerves all over the place, but I'll be darned if I didn't have a blast playing it.</p>

<h3>What To Do With the Green Man in the Shed <small>2012</small></h3>
<p>A soundtrack that was done in co-operation with <strong>Eli Stonemets</strong>. Particularly happy with <i>The Kitchen Scene.</i></p>

<h3>We Will Become Silhouettes <small>2011</small></h3>
<p>This is an old favorite of mine. Recorded with the internal mic on an Apogee ONE, this puppy came out over a single night. The production is kind of crappy now, but I love it.</p>
