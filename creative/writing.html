  <p>That up there is my "author's-biography-pic-in-the-back-of-his-book" face. Mmm, mmm.</p>
  <p>I love to write, and I think it's my favorite way to express my thoughts. Here lies writings that are more than blog posts: they're stories. Some of these originated from NaNoWriMo, too!</p>

<h3>Beagles <small>NaNoWriMo 2012 Novel</small></h3>
